    <br>Here are somethings that I am doing to stay busy during thsi time<br>1. Exerise. In my opion that is the number one thing. It helps you exert all of the energy that you have stored up while at home. Push-ups, running outside, anything inside that burns calories.<br> 2.Do something that you love or like to do. For example, I like to play video games and that is something that I really like to do. <br> 3. Try to have somebody to talk to. Engage in conversations with people in your house to help pass time and to make your brain think.<br> Personally, this virus is not really effecting me becasue i'm not really a person to easily freak out about things so I am usally pretty calm and relaxed during times like this.
