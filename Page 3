    <br> People are freaking out about this virus and here I am to tell you how to stay relaxed and calm during this time.<br>1. Try not to worry too much about the virus. Altough this is a big world wide thing, just try and forget about it.<br>2. Do things that take your mind off of it. Like I discuss in the fouth page, try to do things that make you happy and calm you down.<br>3. Just be happy and have postive thoughts. If you are constatly thinking negitivley, then that will reflect on your attitude as well.
